# DENO-MONGO-REACT-APPLICATION
This is an individual project which is started to develop the end to end flow of simple requirement of having "REMINDER" application based application which can be scaled to any product based idea which is developed based on  
## TECHNOLOGIES ##
DENO - An alternative to node to build servers and develop the backend requirements of the application with more security, modern JS integrations and improve developers coding efficiency.
MONGODB - A well know and easily handled modern database to perform the storage and communication tasks in the application.
REACT - A famous client-side library which is used to create fancy UI pages to interact with the users of the application in the browser.

## FEATURES OF DENO ##
    -> DENO is a modern javascript runtime which supports both javascript and typescript from the beginning of the development process as it has both compilers inbuilt.
    -> DENO as mentioned as the modern tool has the adavancements of javascript feeded into it such as new ES6 features like "imports" and "promises" which can be handled and used easily without any complicated configurations to be made.
    -> DENO, by default is more secure which means that it doesnot allow any third-party pacakges or dependencies interfer with the code to inject unnecessary complications into the application. All, the permissions has to be provided or enabled by the user. 
    -> DENO has the global "deno" object which is useful to interact with certain methods inbuild into it and deno supports the concept of "run-time-api"s which are easily accessed into the application without installing the packages rather importing them directly into the application pointing to the required url's from the deno remote server.
